<meta name="description" content="Simple My Garage Door Keeps Opening After I Close It For Small Space, Your garage door opens immediately after closing. If the door closes before that set distance has been completed, then the opener thinks there’s an error and automatically reverses to prevent property damages or injury.
My garage door sometimes works and sometimes doesn�t. I From quora.com
When your garage door opens or closes when you haven�t triggered the remote, one possible cause is that a neighbor�s remote was programmed at the same time as yours. If your garage door is hard to open or reverses immediately after closing, the simplest thing you can do is check the threshold for anything that blocks it. If it is old or dirty, the button may stick. If your garage door is closing on its own but doesn’t seem to be opening on its own, that could indicate a problem with the opener’s logic board or the circuitry inside of the motor.

<p>Your garage door is programmed to travel a certain distance before it closes. Incorrect travel settings— when your garage door is installed, the opener is programmed with a number that indicates how far down the door is expected to travel before it’s fully closed. This causes the transmitters to not function well in closing the garage door. Removing the door sensor will tell the controller that the door is always opened so it will keep trying to close it.</p>
