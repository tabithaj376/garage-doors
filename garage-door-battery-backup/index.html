Do I Need a Battery Backup to My Garage Door Opener From garagetransformed.com
As of july 1, 2019, the state of california made it a requirement for newly sold or installed residential garage door openers to feature a backup battery. Even when the power is out your gate and garage motor will still be functioning as normal. When the power goes out, the battery provides power to the outlets of the ups. These batteries are not just used in the event of a power failure but are always in use and therefore the motor will stop working when the battery is disconnected.
