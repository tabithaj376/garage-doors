How To Program Old Craftsman Garage Door Opener (6 Easy Steps) From farmfoodfamily.com
When i use the remote (or wall button) to close my garage door, as soon as it hits the ground, it goes right back up. Repeated operation of the garage door as you make the adjustments may cause the opener to overheat and fail to operate. You might need to consider replacing it if your door is not working properly, or you may purchase a new opener. As is the case with so many issues at the home, there’s no one reason why your garage door closes, then opens.
